# Open Source Client Dietary Management for Aged Care

This project is an **open-source client dietary management system** tailored for **aged care** facilities. It is designed to facilitate the communication of residents' dietary requirements to catering departments and staff, ensuring that nutritional needs are met in accordance with medical recommendations and personal preferences. The system also includes comprehensive scheduling for respite care and day center participants, ensuring that the catering department is informed about who will be present and their specific dietary needs.

## Features

- **Dietary Requirement Management**: Create and manage customized diet plans for individual residents, taking into account their specific health needs and dietary restrictions. This feature ensures that catering staff are fully informed of each resident's dietary requirements.

- **Day Centre Management**: Organize and manage meal plans for residents participating in day center programs. This includes scheduling meals and communicating participants' dietary needs to the catering department in advance.

- **Respite Management**: Provides temporary accommodation for clients in aged care facilities, including detailed dietary management during their stay. The system includes scheduling and calendar integration to keep all necessary information readily available for catering purposes, offering seamless support for temporary residents.

## Objective

The primary objective of this system is to improve the quality of care provided to the elderly, with a particular focus on dietary management. By ensuring that the catering department has immediate access to detailed dietary requirements and schedules for respite and day center participants, the system aims to enhance overall health and well-being for all residents. Furthermore, by streamlining the communication process between care management and catering services, the system supports the broader operational needs of aged care facilities.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from developers, nutritionists, caregivers, and anyone with an interest in enhancing aged care through technology. Your contributions, whether in the form of code, documentation, or insight into dietary needs, can significantly impact the lives of the elderly.

Together, we can make a meaningful difference in the care and support of the elderly by improving dietary management and streamlining operational processes within aged care facilities.

## Installation and Operational Guide

Detailed instructions on how to install and run the system will be provided soon, once the project completes its first operational phase. This phase will include sample data to demonstrate the system's capabilities and ensure that it is fully functional for aged care facilities. Stay tuned for updates on the project's progress and for information on how to implement this system to enhance dietary management and support within your facility.
